After his convictions were affirmed, petitioner's application for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was granted to resolve whether the omission of the materiality element from a jury instruction on tax fraud, 26 U.S.C.S. § 7206(1), was harmless error, and whether materiality was an element of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C.S. § 1341, wire fraud, 18 U.S.C.S. § 1343, and bank fraud, 18 U.S.C.S. § 1344.

A federal indictment charged an accused with, among other matters, various counts of (1) mail fraud in violation of 18 USCS 1341, which included a prohibition against the use of the mails with respect to any scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) wire fraud in violation of 18 USCS 1343, which included a prohibition against the use of interstate wire facilities with respect to any scheme or artifice to defraud; (3) bank fraud in violation of 18 USCS 1344, which included a prohibition against any scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution; and (4) tax fraud through filing a false income tax return in violation of 26 USCS 7206(1), which included a prohibition against filing a return which the filer did "not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter."

J., expressing the unanimous view of the court as to holding 3 below and joined by O'Connor, Kennedy, Thomas, and Breyer, JJ., as to holdings 1 and 2 below, it was held that (1) with respect to the tax fraud counts, the District Court's refusal to submit the issue of materiality to the jury, which refusal was not disputed by the Federal Government to have been error, was subject to harmless-error analysis under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for among other factors, (a) the error in question--a jury instruction that omitted an element of the offense--differed markedly from the federal constitutional violations which the Supreme Court had found to defy harmless-error review, and (b) the Federal Constitution's Sixth Amendment guarantee of the right to a jury trial did not require a reversal without any consideration of the effect of the error upon the verdict; (2) this refusal was harmless error under Rule 52(a), where, beyond a reasonable doubt, the omitted element of materiality was uncontested and was supported by overwhelming evidence, such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error; and (3) materiality was an element of the "scheme or artifice to defraud" prohibited by 1341, 1343, and 1344, even though the statutes' text did not mention materiality, where the government (a) did not dispute that at the time of the original enactment of each statute, actionable fraud had a well-settled meaning at common law that required a misrepresentation or concealment of material fact, and (b) had failed to rebut the presumption that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law materiality requirement in the three statutes.

On direct review of an accused's conviction on two counts of tax fraud through filing a false federal income tax return in violation of 26 USCS 7206(1), which prohibited him from filing a return which he did "not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter," a Federal District Court's refusal to submit the issue of materiality to the jury--which refusal is not disputed by the Federal Government to have been error--is subject to harmless-error analysis under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as (1) the error in question--a jury instruction that omitted an element of the offense--(a) differs markedly from the federal constitutional violations which the United States Supreme Court has found to defy harmless-error review, and (b) unlike such defects as the complete deprivation of counsel or trial before a biased judge, does not necessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence; (2) in the case at hand, (a) the accused was tried before an impartial judge, under the correct standard of proof, and with the assistance of counsel, and (b) a fairly selected and impartial jury was instructed to consider all of the evidence and argument in respect to the accused's defense against the tax fraud charges; (3) the Supreme Court has applied harmless-error analysis in other cases--such as those involving improper instruction on a single element or a conclusive presumption--where the jury did not render a "complete verdict" on every element of an offense; (4) while the error in question prevented the jury from making a finding on materiality, the error did not vitiate all of the jury's findings; (5) a "functional equivalence" test proposed by the accused would be (a) inconsistent with the Supreme Court's traditional and categorical approach in determining which errors are subject to harmless-error review, and (b) likely to result in difficulties in implementation; and (6) the Federal Constitution's Sixth Amendment guarantee of the right to a jury trial does not require a reversal without any consideration of the effect of the error upon the verdict, where the accused (a) did not contest the issue of materiality at trial, and (b) does not suggest that he would introduce any evidence bearing on the issue if he were allowed to do so.

With respect to criminal offenses, materiality is an element of the "scheme or artifice to defraud" prohibited by the federal mail fraud (18 USCS 1341), wire fraud (18 USCS 1343), and bank fraud (18 USCS 1344) statutes, even though the statutes' text does not mention materiality, because (1) the Federal Government does not dispute that both at the time of the mail fraud statute's original enactment in 1872--and later when Congress enacted the wire fraud and bank fraud statutes--actionable fraud had a well-settled meaning at common law that required a misrepresentation or concealment of material fact; (2) thus, it must be presumed that Congress intended to incorporate the common-law requirement of materiality unless the three statutes otherwise dictate; and (3) the government has failed to rebut this presumption, for (a) while the government argues that Congress provided express materiality requirements in some other statutes, those statutes differ by prohibiting both "false" and "fraudulent" information and cannot rebut the presumption, as the rebuttal can come from only the text or structure of the three statutes in question, (b) while Durland v United States (1896) 161 US 306, 40 L Ed 709, 16 S Ct 508, held that the mail fraud statute reaches conduct that would not have constituted "false pretenses" at common law, the Durland decision did not hold, as the government argues, that the statute encompasses more than common-law fraud, and (c) while the three statutes in question do not incorporate all of the elements of common-law fraud, the government has failed to show that the statutes' language is inconsistent with a materiality requirement.

Although, by the terms of Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure--which, in governing direct appeals from judgments of conviction in the federal system, provides that any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded--Rule 52(a) applies to all errors where a proper objection is made at trial, there is a limited class of fundamental federal constitutional errors which (1) have been recognized by the United States Supreme Court to defy analysis by harmless-error standards, and (2) are so intrinsically harmful as to require automatic reversal without regard to the errors' effect on the outcome; for all other constitutional errors, reviewing courts must (1) apply Rule 52(a)'s harmless-error analysis, and (2) disregard errors that are harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

For purposes of reviewing criminal defendants' convictions, the federal constitutional violations which have been found by the United States Supreme Court to defy harmless-error review (1) infect the entire trial process, (2) necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair, and (3) deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.

Ct. 2310, but that the error was subject to harmless-error analysis and was harmless because materiality was not in dispute and thus the error did not contribute to the verdict.

Neder understandably contends that Pope, Carella, and Roy fall within this last exception, which explains why the Court in those cases held that the instructional error could be harmless.

In Pope,  for example, there was necessarily a "gap" between what the jury did find (that the allegedly obscene material lacked value under "community standards") and what it was required  to find to convict (that the material lacked value under a national "reasonable person" standard).

Petitioner's submission would have mandated reversal for a new trial in that case, because a juror in Rockford, Illinois, who found that the material lacked value under community standards, would not necessarily have found that it did so under presumably broader and more tolerant national standards.

Neder contends that "defraud" is just such a term, and that Congress implicitly incorporated its common-law meaning, including its requirement of materiality, 5The Restatement instructs that Relevance, Relevant EvidenceHN18A matter is material if: (a) a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question; or (b) the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that its recipient regards or is likely to regard the matter as important in determining his choice of action, although a reasonable man would not so regard it.a matter is material if:"(a) a reasonable man would attach importance to its existence or nonexistence in determining his choice of action in the transaction in question; or"(b) the maker of the representation knows or has reason to know that its recipient regards or is likely to regard the matter as important in determining his choice of action, although a reasonable man would not so regard it."

 [3D] [15A]The Government does not dispute that both at the time of the mail fraud statute's original enactment in 1872, and later when Congress enacted the wire fraud and bank fraud statutes,  actionable "fraud" had a well-settled meaning at common law.
30-31-Congress-legislativeBranch
-----
Thus, under the rule that Congress intends to incorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law terms it uses, we cannot infer from the absence of an express reference to materiality that Congress intended to drop that element from the fraud statutes.

Instead, the Government argues, Congress chose  to unmoor the mail fraud statute from its common-law analogs by punishing, not the completed fraud, but rather any person "having devised or intending to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud."

Read in this light, the Government contends, there is no basis to infer that Congress intended to limit criminal liability to conduct that would constitute "fraud" at common law, and in particular, to material misrepresentations or omissions.

See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, 872 F.2d 957, 960 (CA10 1989) ("[Under the mail fraud statute,] the government does not have to prove actual reliance upon the defendant's misrepresentations"); United States v. Rowe, 56 F.2d 747, 749 (CA2) (L. Hand, J.)

The three contrasting opinions in Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302, 111 S. Ct. 1246 (1991), vividly illustrate this point: Justice White stated that the admission of a defendant's coerced confession, by its very nature, could never be harmless, id. at 295-302; JUSTICE KENNEDY stated that such evidence can be harmless but that the appellate court "must appreciate the indelible impact a full confession may have on the trier of fact," id. at 313 (opinion concurring in judgment); and THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, stated that the admission of such evidence presents "a classic case of harmless error" when other evidence points strongly towards guilt, id. at 312 (dissenting opinion).

If the Court's tolerance of the trial judge's Sixth Amendment error in this case were, as JUSTICE SCALIA's dissent suggests, post, at 1, as serious as malpractice on "the spinal column of American  democracy," surely the error would require reversal of the conviction regardless of whether defense counsel made a timely objection.

As the history of many of our now-valued works of art demonstrates, this error would have permitted the jury to resolve the issue against the defendants based on their appraisal of the views of the majority of Illinois' citizens despite the fact that under  a proper instruction the jury would have acquitted if they thought a more discerning minority would have found true artistic value in the publications.
